# Wind Layer Integration and NOAA Data Automation

## Project Overview

This project is attempting to integrate the [wind-layer](https://github.com/sakitam-fdd/wind-layer) library into a React application to visualize wind data. Additionally, it automates the process of fetching updated weather data from NOAA, ensuring the application always displays the latest information.
